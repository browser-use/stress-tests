## Features

Each form includes:

- Character-restricted fields (alphanumeric only)
- Disabled fields
- Red herring modal buttons (opens a modal instead of submitting)
- Form validation
- Submit buttons
- All forms will display `the secret is: dumbledore` upon succesful submission to make evals easy to validate

## Special Testing Cases

The Wufoo-style form is specifically designed to challenge autofill systems with:
- Unusual field naming conventions
- Nested form structures
- Non-standard input patterns
- Split fields (separate month/day/year selects)
- Honeypot fields
- Fields with prefixes/suffixes

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Test your autofill browser extension against each form
3. Check for proper field recognition and filling

## Development

This is a purely frontend project with no build steps required. All forms are self-contained in their respective HTML files.
